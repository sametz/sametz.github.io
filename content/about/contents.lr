title: About Me
---
body:

I am an Assistant Professor of Organic Chemistry and Lab Manager at the University of Delaware.

I am trying to learn enough Python to create useful things, and to make life easier.

Current interests include:

- simulation of NMR spectra, including Dynamic NMR (DNMR)
- Raspberry Pi and other boards, and their potential applications in chemical instrumentation
- data acquisition, scrounging, analysis and visualization

Caveat: "interest" != "expertise"
